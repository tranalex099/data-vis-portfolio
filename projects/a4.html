    <h2>Proposition: Foreign aid is effective in increasing educational outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa.</h2>

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="a4_files/for_prop.png" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					The amount of aid recieved by countries in Sub-Saharan Africa is linearly correlated to the percentage of students enrolled in secondary school.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Since there is a strong linear correlation across time, a line chart showing the trends would be effective in convincing the audience of the proposition. As the trend is strong, we do not need to do too much to convince the audience of our affective goals. Doing less would be better here as to appear as a more neutral source.</li>
				<li>Using small multiples, we can compare the trends over time. Since we want to compare how they change over time, having the charts share the x-axis for year would make it easier to make this comparison.</li>
				<li>For the title, a simple title stating the trend noticed would be most effective here. As previously stated, we want to appear neutral and unbiased and let the visualization speak for itself as it supports our proposition. Similarly, the labels and axes should also be simple.</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="a4_files/against_prop.png" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					Increasing aid in Sub-Saharan Africa is not decreasing the amount of youth not in education, employment, or training.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Similar to above, we want to compare how increasing aid over time changes another indicator over time. A line chart best displays the changes over time. Since there is a lot of missiing data points for the Share of youth not in education, employment, or training, we trimmed the years measure only the years with both data points.</li>
				<li>The small multiples here would point attention to the trend, or rather, lack thereof which is what we want to focus on. Having them share the x-axis for year again would allow for quick comparisons. To stay consistent between the two comparisons, we want to use the constant 2018 US$ between the visualizations.</li>
				<li>Since the trend we want to point out (a positive correlation) is weak, we want to reframe the title. Rather than using it to point out the trend, we want to point out the recent years that may be outliers and focus our attention on them instead of the previous years that display a somewhat negative trend. As the correlation is not strong, we cannot afford to be too neutral here if we want to achieve our affective goals.</li>
