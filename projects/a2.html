			<h2>Subtheme: Exclusionary Zoning</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					What and how severe are the demographic differences
					between areas with exclusionary single-family zoning
					and areas with more inclusive zoning regulations in
					Metro Boston towns and cities?
				</li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Motivation: In "Exclusionary by Design: An Investigation of
							Zoning’s Use as a Tool of Race, Class, and Family Exclusion in
							Boston’s Suburbs, 1920 to Today" zoning was historically used to
							perpetuate racial and socioeconomic segregation. Exploring current
							demographic differences can provide insights into the impact of
							exclusionary zoning on various communities.
						</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					To what extent does the prevalence of exclusionary
					single-family zoning correlate with household income
					in Metro Boston?
				</li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Motivation: The article "Cities Start to Question an American Ideal: A
							House With a Yard on Every Lot" discusses how exclusionary zoning
							practices contribute to unaffordable housing, particularly for lower
							and moderate-income households. Examining the relationship between
							zoning regulations and household income can inform discussions on
							the need for zoning reform.
						</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					How do historical land use patterns through geography or
					infrastructure contribute to current disparities in housing
					zoning across Metro Boston municipalities?
				</li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Motivation: In "Cities Start to Question an American Ideal: A
							House With a Yard on Every Lot," certain cities show a correlation
							between the presence of public transport routes and the prevalence
							of single-family zoning, indicating a historical trend of land use
							patterns influenced by infrastructure development. Understanding
							the historical context of how geography and infrastructure have
							shaped zoning regulations can provide insights into current
							disparities in housing access and affordability.

				<figcaption>
				This chart compares the Metro Boston Municipals by the percentage
				of single family zoning in each municipal. The data is skewed towards
				a large portion of municipals that have no single family zoning. Each
				data point in this dataset is a housing zone but something to be aware
				of is that some municipals have two data entries; one for single family
				zoning and another for multifamily zoning.

				<img src="Vis%20&amp;%20Society%20Assignment%202_files/avg-age-zoning.png" alt="Percentage of Single Family Housing in Metro Boston Municipals">
				<figcaption>
				Using the census data of the population of a municipal under 18,
				18-64, and 65+, along with its total population, we are able to
				approximate an average age for the municipal. This will let us
				see any trends in age and zoning laws. However, aside from Milton
				being an outlier, there seems to be no correlation between the age
				of a municipal and the percentage of single family zoning though
				another demographic may have a better correlation.

				<img src="Vis%20&amp;%20Society%20Assignment%202_files/percent-zoning-map.png" alt="Percentage of Single Family Housing in Metro Boston Municipals">
				<figcaption>
				This maps out the municipals according to their percentage of single
				family zoning. Using this, we can look for any geographic trends that
				might influence single family zoning. Through this visualization, it
				seems that single family zoning is more prevalent in the South and
				West of Metro Boston. Very rarely do we also see any single family
				zoning near the coastline.

				<img src="Vis%20&amp;%20Society%20Assignment%202_files/map-white-zoning.png" alt="">
				<figcaption>
				As we are interested in the correlation between single family zoning
				and demographics, we compare the percentage of single family zoning
				and Non-Hispanic White population which we can calculate using the
				population data. It generally seems that in urban areas we can expect
				both to decrease. However, rural areas seem to not follow this
				correlation as closely. This may be due to a lower population and
				excess land available which leads to less needs for zoning. While
				single family zoning follows Non-Hispanic White population decently
				well, we should see if other factors such as gender income are better
				predictors.

				<img src="Vis%20&amp;%20Society%20Assignment%202_files/percent-female-zoning.png" alt="">
				<figcaption>
				Looking at percentage of women in a municipal is shown to be a strong
				predictor of single family zoning, at least in the instance of a large
				percentage of women being highly correlated with a large percentage of
				single family zoning. While certain demographic data is well correlated
				with single family zoning, single family zoning has also been used to
				discriminate against socioeconomic status and not just on race. This
				leads us into our next question of income and zoning practices.
