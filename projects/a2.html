        <h2>Subtheme: Exclusionary Zoning</h2>

        <h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            What and how severe are the demographic differences between areas
            with exclusionary single-family zoning and areas with more inclusive
            zoning regulations in Metro Boston towns and cities?
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Motivation: In "Exclusionary by Design: An Investigation of
              Zoning’s Use as a Tool of Race, Class, and Family Exclusion in
              Boston’s Suburbs, 1920 to Today" zoning was historically used to
              perpetuate racial and socioeconomic segregation. Exploring current
              demographic differences can provide insights into the impact of
              exclusionary zoning on various communities.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            To what extent does the prevalence of exclusionary single-family
            zoning correlate with household income in Metro Boston?
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Motivation: The article "Cities Start to Question an American
              Ideal: A House With a Yard on Every Lot" discusses how
              exclusionary zoning practices contribute to unaffordable housing,
              particularly for lower and moderate-income households. Examining
              the relationship between zoning regulations and household income
              can inform discussions on the need for zoning reform.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            How do historical land use patterns through geography or
            infrastructure contribute to current disparities in housing zoning
            across Metro Boston municipalities?
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Motivation: In "Cities Start to Question an American Ideal: A
              House With a Yard on Every Lot," certain cities show a correlation
              between the presence of public transport routes and the prevalence
              of single-family zoning, indicating a historical trend of land use
              patterns influenced by infrastructure development. Understanding
              the historical context of how geography and infrastructure have
              shaped zoning regulations can provide insights into current
              disparities in housing access and affordability.

            This chart compares the Metro Boston Municipals by the percentage of
            single family zoning in each municipal. The data is skewed towards a
            large portion of municipals that have no single family zoning. Each
            data point in this dataset is a housing zone but something to be
            aware of is that some municipals have two data entries; one for
            single family zoning and another for multifamily zoning.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

          />
          <figcaption>
            Using the census data of the population of a municipal under 18,
            18-64, and 65+, along with its total population, we are able to
            approximate an average age for the municipal. This will let us see
            any trends in age and zoning laws. However, aside from Milton being
            an outlier, there seems to be no correlation between the age of a
            municipal and the percentage of single family zoning though another
            demographic may have a better correlation.
          </figcaption>

          <figcaption>
            This maps out the municipals according to their percentage of single
            family zoning. Using this, we can look for any geographic trends
            that might influence single family zoning. Through this
            visualization, it seems that single family zoning is more prevalent
            in the South and West of Metro Boston. Very rarely do we also see
            any single family zoning near the coastline.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="Vis%20&amp;%20Society%20Assignment%202_files/map-white-zoning.png"
            alt=""
          />
          <figcaption>
            As we are interested in the correlation between single family zoning
            and demographics, we compare the percentage of single family zoning
            and Non-Hispanic White population which we can calculate using the
            population data. It generally seems that in urban areas we can
            expect both to decrease. However, rural areas seem to not follow
            this correlation as closely. This may be due to a lower population
            and excess land available which leads to less needs for zoning.
            While single family zoning follows Non-Hispanic White population
            decently well, we should see if other factors such as gender income
            are better predictors.
          </figcaption>

          <figcaption>
            Looking at percentage of women in a municipal is shown to be a
            strong predictor of single family zoning, at least in the instance
            of a large percentage of women being highly correlated with a large
            percentage of single family zoning. Something to be aware of when
            charting the percentages are the duplicate entries mentioned before
            so we should make sure to use weighted averages instead of the
            normal average. This applies here and on all of the percentage and
            average measurements calculated. While certain demographic data is
            well correlated with single family zoning, single family zoning has
            also been used to discriminate against socioeconomic status and not
            just on race. This leads us into our next question of income and
            zoning practices.
          </figcaption>

          />
          <figcaption>
            Plotting the household income against the percentage of single
            family zoning, we are able to see some correlation between the two.
            If we do not consider the municipals with no single family zoning,
            the correlation is much stronger. Something to note about the income
            data is that it was taken four to eight years after the census data
            and certain zoning areas that are too small lose some income data. While age here does seem to show any trends, political data on these municipals might in this instance.

            alt=""
          />
          <figcaption>In this chart, we go back to comparing Non-Hispanic Whites to the percentage of single family zoning. However, this time we also encode the data about municipal household income. Similar to above, we notice a slight correlation in the percentage of Non-Hispanic Whites and single family zoning if we don't consider the municipals that do not have single family zoning. An interesting observation here is that we see two clusters of high average household income in the top left and the top right. This indicates that areas with lots of wealthy non-hispanic white people tend to either be very suburban and residential or urban with no inbetween.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
          <img

            alt=""
          />
          <figcaption>From the previous visualization, there seemed to be a high correlation between a municipal's household income and its percentage of non-hispanic whites. I wanted to check this correlation as it might be stronger than either measure with the percentage of single family zoning. It does seem that the correlation between income and race is much stronger which leads us to the question of whether single family zoning is on much less race today than it is on socioeconomic status. Rather than continue with race, it would be more beneficial to see other demographic correlations with household income such as gender.</figcaption>

            alt=""
          />
          <figcaption>While we somewhat see a correlation between the percentage of men and the household income in a municipal, it is not nearly as strong as between race and income. Something suprising is that the correlation is negative. Due to the historical wage gap, this is an unexpected result. If we control for race, we might be able to see better trends. Generally, income currently seems to be a much stronger indication of zoning status than demographic.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>This map illustrates the distribution of multifamily and single-family zoning across Metro Boston municipalities. Splitting the data into areas with and without single family zoning will allow us to notice any geographical trends. A lot of the multifamily zones are clustered around the coast and single family zoning encircles the multifamily zones. It becomes clearer through this visualization that multifamily zones are typically more urban cities whereas the single family zones are the suburbs around it.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>The map above illustrates the non-MBTA and MBTA municipals. The two inland non-MBTA zones are very heavily disconnected from the system. One of the non-MBTA zones does not have any single family zoning and is positioned closer to coast.</figcaption>

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>Overall, it seems that in the past the exclusionary zoning was targeted towards race. However, while there is still a slight correlation between race and percentage of single family zoning today, it is not particularly strong. The same goes for income. What we do see is a strong correlation between a municipal's racial demographic and income. What this, and the two clusters in Figure 7, may suggest is that we need to further separate the municipals in urban and non-urban if we wish to see trends in race and income. Due to the high amount of MBTA communities in listed, it was hard to compare the two and see any trends. However, a suprising trend in the geography was the lack of single family zoning near the coast.</p>
