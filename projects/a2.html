			<h2>Subtheme: Exclusionary Zoning</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					What and how severe are the demographic differences
					between areas with exclusionary single-family zoning
					and areas with more inclusive zoning regulations in
					Metro Boston towns and cities?
				</li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Motivation: In "Exclusionary by Design: An Investigation of
							Zoning’s Use as a Tool of Race, Class, and Family Exclusion in
							Boston’s Suburbs, 1920 to Today" zoning was historically used to
							perpetuate racial and socioeconomic segregation. Exploring current
							demographic differences can provide insights into the impact of
							exclusionary zoning on various communities.
						</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					To what extent does the prevalence of exclusionary
					single-family zoning correlate with household income
					in Metro Boston?
				</li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Motivation: The article "Cities Start to Question an American Ideal: A
							House With a Yard on Every Lot" discusses how exclusionary zoning
							practices contribute to unaffordable housing, particularly for lower
							and moderate-income households. Examining the relationship between
							zoning regulations and household income can inform discussions on
							the need for zoning reform.
						</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					How do historical land use patterns through geography or
					infrastructure contribute to current disparities in housing
					zoning across Metro Boston municipalities?
				</li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Motivation: In "Cities Start to Question an American Ideal: A
							House With a Yard on Every Lot," certain cities show a correlation
							between the presence of public transport routes and the prevalence
							of single-family zoning, indicating a historical trend of land use
							patterns influenced by infrastructure development. Understanding
							the historical context of how geography and infrastructure have
							shaped zoning regulations can provide insights into current
							disparities in housing access and affordability.

				This chart compares the Metro Boston Municipals by the percentage
				of single family zoning in each municipal. The data is skewed towards
				a large portion of municipals that have no single family zoning. Each
				data point in this dataset is a housing zone but something to be aware
				of is that some municipals have two data entries; one for single family
				zoning and another for multifamily zoning.
