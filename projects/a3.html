			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

      <figure>
				<img src="a3_files/gender-line.jpg" alt="">
				<figcaption>
					Gender Discrepancy across Wartime Demographics. The question for the visualizations that I tried to answer in Phase One were how gender imbalances change throughout a population whether through external factors or through the life cycle of a population. This stacked line chart shows the surplus of men or women throughout a given age range with blue being more men and red being more women. The annotated years represent the median age of veterans of that war from that year's census. Generally, it means they would be late twenties to early thirties during the mentioned war.

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>In this sketch, I wanted to explore if wars would have a noticeable effect on the surplus of men or women from that age group. I was hoping to find a trend in the population of the demographic itself and the surplus of men or women during a period of war. </li>
				<li>The stacked line chart would allow us to place extra focus on the difference between men and women. It is also nice for following the trend of how the difference is changing. While it is hard to follow the actual changes in gender imbalances, we can see it as a proportion of the entire population which gives it more perspective. Moreover, we are able to graph both years' census on top of each other for a direct comparison between the two centuries.</li>
				<li>Since, aside from World War 2, we do not see any major changes in the population or gender ratio, I would like to explore other factors that may change the gender ratio in my next visualizations.</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img src="a3_files/gender-bar.jpg" alt="" class="rotate-image">
				<figcaption>
          			Change in U.S. Gender Breakdown across Social and Economic Turning Points. This bar chart represents the surplus of men or women in a given age range with blue being more men and red being more women. The annotated regions represent what was happening socially and economically during the years that group was born.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Building off of what we found in the first sketch, I wanted to explore other factors that may influence the gender surpluses and ratios that we see in certain age ranges. Since wartime was not a particularly strong correlation, I wanted to explore the major social and economic turning points and their potential effects.</li>
				<li>Since it was hard to discern the difference in the last Visualization, I wanted to focus more on the discrepancy itself and did away with the overall population data. We are able to clearly see the difference as a result and compare the differences across times but we lose how massive this differnce is compared to the population. For instance, 2000 has much larger differences than 1900 but the population of 2000 is also much greater.</li>
				<li>We are able to see much stronger trends here than previously with the wars. However, moving forward, I wonder how much of the change in gender and population ratio is due to natural aging rather than the external factors explored.</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img src="a3_files/gender-square.jpg" alt="" class="rotate-image">
				<figcaption>
          			Gender Ratio across Stages of Life. The stages of life are scaled to be the percentage of the total population for that year's census. Each stage is further divided into the area being equivalent to the percentage of the gender ratio for that stage of life with blue representing men and red representing women.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>In this sketch, I wanted to explore how the population and gender ratio changes throughout the stages of life.</li>
				<li>The area is proportional to how much that subsection is to the total population. This allows us to make comparisons between the populations of adjacent stages of life. I think this chart does a much better job than the first figure of showing the difference in population between young kids and the eldery, especially since the area is proportinal whereas even in a population pyramid it may not be. However, comparing the gender breakdowns is hard to do even within the same stage of life.</li>
				<li>Looking at the different stages of life was really interesting to see so I want to bin the age groups into a more formally defined grouping such as their generations and compare taht instead.</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        The line chart clearly represents the discrepancy without sacrifing the overall data. However, the overall data may not necessarily be useful. The bar chart provides a clearer representation by focusing solely on the gender differences within age groups and annotating social and economic turning points to contextualize these imbalances. However, it sacrifices overall population data for a more direct comparison of gender discrepancies across periods. The square chart offers a distinct perspective by representing gender ratios across stages of life as proportional areas, highlighting differences within each stage. While insightful, comparing gender breakdowns between stages may be challenging. The figure is interesting to look at but hard to parse any information from or use to form a conclusion.

			<h2>Phase Two: Final Design</h2>

			<figure>
				<img src="a3_files/generation-bubbles.png" alt="">
				<figcaption>
				Gender and Generational Breakdown of 1900 and 2000 Census Population. The two populations from the census are broken down into their generational makeup and further divided according to their gender. The size of the bubbles are proportional to how large the population of that group is.

			<h2>Design Process &amp; Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
				My design process began with an analysis of the available census data from 1900 and 2000, aiming to visualize the gender and generational breakdowns within these populations. I decided to represent the data using bubble charts to effectively illustrate both the generational composition and gender distribution. Each bubble's size correlates with the population size of its respective group, providing a clear visual comparison between the two census years. Additionally, I chose to organize the bubbles by generation to highlight the demographic shifts over time and emphasize any disparities in gender representation across generations.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        This visualization effectively captures the gender and generational dynamics within the 1900 and 2000 census populations. By employing bubble charts, the design allows for easy comparison of population sizes and gender distributions between the two time periods. However, while the size of the bubbles provides a clear indication of population proportions, it might be challenging to discern precise numerical values without additional labeling or interaction. Overall, the visualization successfully conveys the changes in gender and generational demographics over a century, facilitating an understanding of societal shifts and population trends.
