			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

      <figure>

					Gender Discrepancy across Wartime Demographics. The question for the visualizations that I tried to answer in Phase One were how gender imbalances change throughout a population whether through external factors or through the life cycle of a population. This stacked line chart shows the surplus of men or women throughout a given age range with blue being more men and red being more women. The annotated years represent the median age of veterans of that war from that year's census. Generally, it means they would be late twenties to early thirties during the mentioned war.

          			Change in U.S. Gender Breakdown across Social and Economic Turning Points. This bar chart represents the surplus of men or women in a given age range with blue being more men and red being more women. The annotated regions represent what was happening socially and economically during the years that group was born.

				<figcaption>
          			Gender Ratio across Stages of Life. The stages of life are scaled to be the percentage of the total population for that year's census. Each stage is further divided into the area being equivalent to the percentage of the gender ratio for that stage of life with blue representing men and red representing women.
